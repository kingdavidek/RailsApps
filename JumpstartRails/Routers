Routers


When a Rails server gets a request from a web browser it first goes to the router. The router decides what the request is trying to do, what resources it is trying to interact with.

When the router knows how to handle requests about articles, it needs a place to actually send those requests, the Controller.



Adding links and new routes:	/
--------------------------------/


We’ll use the link_to helper, we want it to display the text "Create a New Article", and where should it point? Look in the routing table for the new action, that’s where the form to create a new article will live. You’ll find the name new_article, so the helper is new_article_path.
